JuicyReddit
===========

A Windows 8 reddit application made for a college project
It isn't fully featured at the moment. 
It is missing the feature to automatically load in new items, so as of now it only displays the first 25 items on the selected Subreddit. Also it does not display images. I plan to fix this soon
